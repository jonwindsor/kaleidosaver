# Kaleidosaver
A repository for [Kaleidosaver](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1350259), a screensaver composed using p5.js. Created as an assignment for Creative Coding (DGST 302) at the University of Mary Washington.

## Background and Function
The code itself is based off of Zach Whalen's 'Move and Bounce' sketch, though instead of 2D primitives, this sketch utilizes WEB-GL to implement a 3D torus. This torus bounces between two points, with x, y, and z detected. The product resembles a kaleidoscope.

## Feats, Struggles, and Reflection
While tinkering with the 'Move and Bounce' sketch and 3D primitives, this result unintentionally was produced. A screensaver sketch using a different shape (a cone) can be found [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1340659). The resulting product is vastly different. I was surprised by the result of both sketches, consisting of a sort of psychadelic aesthetic.
